This is the project repositary for the final assignment. All the code is in main.js as it was easier to track the progress for me.
Despite that the code is readable.

This project is also acompanied by a video, that has been submitted into teams.

-There are parts of the code undisclosed in the video and that's because I was trying to fix or add some features after I wrote
the video script.
